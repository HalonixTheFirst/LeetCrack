# LeetCrack - Track and Solve LeetCode Problems using AI
#### Video.mp4
#### Use LeetCrack to track your solved leetcode problems and get AI solutions with intuition, approach, code and complexity analysis instantly.

LeetCrack uses python with flask , HTML , BootStrap CSS and Javascript. It uses sqlite to track user sessions and also to track each user's solved problems. A user can request a maximum of 5 AI solutions using gemini API per day. The AI solution consists of the intuition , approach , code implementation in C++ and Python.
Llama model 7b is also supported if it exists.

#### Planned Improvements:
    - Request clarification from the AI for solutions.
    - Transfer database from sqlite to PostGres.
    - Implement Javascript in certain areas to avoid page reloading for each request.
    - Deploy project using vercel.
